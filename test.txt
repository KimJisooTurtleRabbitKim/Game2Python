students to try to put yourselves in your  parents' shoes and answer these
questions for the scenarios mentioned :
- What would my worst fear be?
- How could you talk to me about these fears?
- How could you show me that you are ready for this responsibility?
- What would be a fair solution to this problem?


(Girls) You are going out with your friends to a grand school dance. You've bought
some new clothes and jewelry for the event. You spend a lot of time getting
dressed and putting on your make up and you think you look great. But when you
come downstairs, your parents get upset and say that girls your age shouldn't
dress that way - dress is too short, too much makeup, etc.


(Boys) You have a friend who always gets in trouble. Your parents want you to stop
spending time with him. You still like him and don't think your parents understand.
He asks you to spend Saturday with him at his house. Now you have to get your
parentsâ€™ permission.


Thought Provoker: Has there ever been a time when your parents trusted you and
you let them down? What happened? Was it harder to get them to trust you
afterwards? Were you able to rebuild the lost trust? How? What have you learned
from this experience?
